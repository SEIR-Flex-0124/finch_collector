# Finch Collector(Different Relationships)

You will be continuing your finch collector application that we started previously. Your goal will be the following:

- Add a second model with a one-to-many relationship to your first model.
- Add that model to your views.
- Add an additional model method to one of your models to improve your template output.
- Add CRUD functionality for your second model.
- Look to continue doing the same but with a many-to-many relationship, which will require you to create a join table.
